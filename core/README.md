# Catalyst Control Plane (`core/`)

The Go application that implements the **Catalyst control plane** — the user-facing UI and the controllers that turn a Kubernetes cluster into a **Sovereign**.

**Status:** Design + scaffolded. This directory currently contains the agreed structure as `.gitkeep` placeholders — Go code is yet to be written.
**Updated:** 2026-04-27.

> **Read first:** [`docs/GLOSSARY.md`](../docs/GLOSSARY.md), [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md`](../docs/IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md). This README assumes that context. The structure below describes the **target** layout once implementation begins.

---

## What this is

A single Go application (the `core/` directory) packaged as multiple components of the Catalyst control plane. The same codebase produces:

- **console** — the primary user-facing UI (Astro/Svelte/React frontend served by a Go backend).
- **marketplace** — the public-facing Blueprint card grid.
- **admin** — the `sovereign-admin` operations UI.
- **provisioning** — the service that validates configSchema, composes manifests, commits to Environment Gitea repos.
- **projector** — the CQRS read-side service: NATS JetStream → KV → SSE.
- **catalog-svc** — Blueprint catalog API.
- **environment-controller** — reconciles the Environment CRD (vcluster + Flux + Gitea + webhook).
- **blueprint-controller** — watches Blueprint repositories.
- **billing** — per-Org metering.

These are deployed as separate workloads but share most of the codebase via internal packages.

---

## What this is **not**

- It is **not** a "bootstrap wizard" + "lifecycle manager" duo. The historical split between those two is gone — both fold into the Catalyst control plane. Phase 0 bootstrap is performed by `catalyst-provisioner` (an OpenOva-hosted service or a customer-deployed Blueprint) running OpenTofu; thereafter, the control plane runs continuously inside the Sovereign.
- It is **not** Crossplane. Crossplane is an infrastructure dependency, deployed alongside.
- It is **not** Backstage. The Catalyst console is purpose-built for Catalyst's data model; we don't reuse Backstage's plugin system.

---

## Target directory structure

This is the structure once implementation begins. Today, the `apps/`, `internal/`, `pkg/`, `ui/`, and `deploy/` directories exist as `.gitkeep` placeholders only.

```
core/
├── apps/                  # one binary per control-plane component
│   ├── console/           # console + marketplace + admin (frontend + Go backend)
│   ├── projector/         # CQRS projector service (NATS JetStream → KV → SSE)
│   ├── environment-controller/   # reconciles Environment CRD (vcluster + Flux + Gitea)
│   ├── blueprint-controller/   # watches Blueprint folders/repos, registers CRDs
│   ├── provisioning/      # validates configSchema, commits to Environment Gitea
│   ├── catalog-svc/       # serves Blueprint catalog API
│   └── billing/           # per-Org metering
├── internal/
│   ├── domain/            # Pure business logic, zero infra deps
│   │   ├── sovereign.go
│   │   ├── organization.go
│   │   ├── environment.go
│   │   ├── application.go
│   │   ├── blueprint.go
│   │   └── events.go
│   ├── application/       # Use cases / orchestration
│   ├── adapters/          # Infrastructure adapters
│   │   ├── kubernetes/
│   │   ├── crossplane/
│   │   ├── opentofu/      # bootstrap-only
│   │   ├── gitea/
│   │   ├── jetstream/     # NATS JetStream
│   │   ├── openbao/
│   │   └── keycloak/
│   └── events/            # CloudEvents envelopes
├── pkg/
│   └── apis/v1alpha1/     # CRD types: Sovereign, Organization, Environment, Application, Blueprint, EnvironmentPolicy, SecretPolicy, Runbook
├── ui/                    # Frontend (Astro + Svelte; same codebase serves console / marketplace / admin via routes)
└── deploy/                # Kustomize bases for each control-plane component
```

The `.gitkeep` directories in this tree are deliberate — they pin the agreed layout while implementation work is scheduled. As each binary or package is written, its `.gitkeep` is removed and the corresponding row in [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md`](../docs/IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md) flips from 📐 to ✅.

### Legacy `apps/bootstrap/` and `apps/manager/` placeholders

The current filesystem also contains `apps/bootstrap/` and `apps/manager/` — empty directories from an earlier (now retired) split where bootstrap and lifecycle-management were modeled as separate binaries. These two folders will be removed when the new `apps/` layout above is scaffolded; we keep them in the meantime to avoid spurious `git rm` churn before there's anything to replace them with.

## CRDs (in `pkg/apis/v1alpha1/`)

```yaml
apiVersion: catalyst.openova.io/v1alpha1
kind: Sovereign            # the top-level deployment object
─────────────────────────
kind: Organization         # multi-tenancy unit inside a Sovereign
─────────────────────────
kind: Environment          # {org}-{env_type} scope; vcluster + Gitea repo
─────────────────────────
kind: Application          # an installed Blueprint
─────────────────────────
kind: Blueprint            # registered from a Blueprint repo
─────────────────────────
kind: EnvironmentPolicy    # PR / soak / change-window rules per Env
─────────────────────────
kind: SecretPolicy         # rotation rules
─────────────────────────
kind: Runbook              # auto-remediation runbooks
```

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for how these compose, and [`docs/BLUEPRINT-AUTHORING.md`](../docs/BLUEPRINT-AUTHORING.md) for the Blueprint CRD spec.

## Hexagonal architecture

```
                    ┌───────────────────────┐
   HTTP handlers ──►│                       │──► Kubernetes API
   K8s controllers ►│   Domain (pure Go)    │──► OpenBao
   JetStream subs ─►│                       │──► Gitea
   SSE clients   ◄──│                       │──► Crossplane
                    └───────────────────────┘
                          (zero external deps)
```

The domain layer is pure Go. All I/O goes through adapters in `internal/adapters/`. This keeps the core business logic (Sovereign, Organization, Environment, Application, Blueprint state machines) independent of any specific infrastructure choice — easy to test, easy to swap adapters when a backing technology evolves.

---

## Event-driven core

```go
// Domain emits events
type ApplicationInstallRequested struct {
    Environment string
    Name        string
    Blueprint   BlueprintRef
    Values      ConfigValues
}

// Bus routes to handlers (in-process Go channels for fast path,
// JetStream for durable / cross-service fan-out)
bus.Subscribe(ApplicationInstallRequested{}, func(e Event) {
    plan := planner.Compose(e)
    git.Commit(e.Environment.GiteaRepo, plan.Manifests)
    events.Publish("ws.<env>.application.installing", e)
})
```

The internal in-process bus and the JetStream spine use the same envelope shape (CloudEvents). Local tests run with the in-process bus; production runs with JetStream as the durable transport.

---

## Reconciliation pattern (Manager components)

Standard controller-runtime style:

```go
func (r *EnvironmentReconciler) Reconcile(ctx context.Context, req ctrl.Request) (ctrl.Result, error) {
    var env catalystv1.Environment
    if err := r.Get(ctx, req.NamespacedName, &env); err != nil {
        return ctrl.Result{}, client.IgnoreNotFound(err)
    }

    // Ensure vcluster
    if err := r.ensureVCluster(ctx, &env); err != nil {
        return ctrl.Result{}, err
    }
    // Ensure Gitea repo
    if err := r.ensureGiteaRepo(ctx, &env); err != nil {
        return ctrl.Result{}, err
    }
    // Bootstrap Flux inside vcluster
    if err := r.ensureFluxBootstrap(ctx, &env); err != nil {
        return ctrl.Result{}, err
    }
    // Wire webhook
    if err := r.ensureWebhook(ctx, &env); err != nil {
        return ctrl.Result{}, err
    }
    return ctrl.Result{RequeueAfter: 30 * time.Second}, nil
}
```

Per-CRD reconcilers live under `apps/<controller>/internal/`. Each is its own deployable component to keep blast-radius small (a bug in `blueprint-controller` cannot stall `environment-controller`).

## User journeys (implementation references)

| Journey | Where it lands |
|---|---|
| Sovereign bootstrap | Phase 0 is done by `catalyst-provisioner` — a **separate Blueprint** (`bp-catalyst-provisioner`), not part of `core/`. See [`docs/SOVEREIGN-PROVISIONING.md`](../docs/SOVEREIGN-PROVISIONING.md) §2. The `apps/provisioning/` service in `core/` is for **runtime Application provisioning** (validate configSchema, compose manifests, commit to the Environment's Gitea repo) — not bootstrap. |
| Environment creation | `environment-controller` reconciles an `Environment` CR. |
| Application install | `apps/provisioning/` validates and commits to the Environment's Gitea repo. Flux (in the vcluster) reconciles. |
| Promotion between Environments | `apps/console/` opens a Gitea PR; `EnvironmentPolicy` controller gates merges. |
| Observability fanout | `apps/projector/` consumes JetStream, writes JetStream KV, fans SSE to console clients. |
| Blueprint registration | `apps/blueprint-controller/` watches Blueprint repos, validates, registers. |

## Local development

```bash
# Run console (frontend + Go backend)
cd core/apps/console
go run .

# Run projector
cd core/apps/projector
go run .

# Run a controller against a local kind cluster
cd core/apps/environment-controller
kind create cluster --name catalyst-dev
go run . --kubeconfig $HOME/.kube/config

# Frontend dev mode
cd core/ui
npm install
npm run dev

# Build all containers
ko build ./apps/...
```

Each `apps/<x>` folder is a separate Go module entrypoint; they share `internal/` and `pkg/` via the parent module.

---

## Deployment

Each component has a Kustomize base under `deploy/<component>/`. The umbrella Blueprint `bp-catalyst-platform` (in `products/catalyst/`) composes all of them into a single deploy unit.

For Sovereign-level provisioning details see [`docs/SOVEREIGN-PROVISIONING.md`](../docs/SOVEREIGN-PROVISIONING.md).
