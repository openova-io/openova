## 1. Executive Summary

OpenOva is an enterprise-grade support provider for open-source Kubernetes ecosystems. We provide a converged, production-ready platform of 40+ integrated CNCF components - deployed in hours, backed by AI-powered operations, and supported by a network of deep open-source specialists.

We serve organizations that want the economics and freedom of open source with the confidence and operational guarantees of a vendor relationship. Our customers range from banks navigating PSD2 compliance to enterprises breaking free from proprietary platforms like OpenShift, VMware, and Datadog.

**What makes us different:**

- **Turnkey ecosystem, not a single tool.** 41 curated CNCF components tested and certified to work together. What takes 2-3 years to build internally, we deploy in hours.
- **Consultancy and platform from day one.** We meet customers where they are - whether they need a guide, a platform, or both.
- **AI-powered self-healing operations.** OpenOva Specter eliminates 70%+ of traditional SOC/NOC staffing needs through autonomous monitoring, incident response, and remediation.
- **Open source, genuinely.** Blueprints are free forever. We charge for support, managed services, and expertise - not for access to code.
- **40+ open-source disciplines, one relationship.** Our expert network spans PostgreSQL, Kafka, Cilium, Keycloak, AI/ML, and dozens more - all under one support contract.

## 2. Vision & Mission

### Vision

Become the definitive enterprise support company for the open-source cloud-native ecosystem - the Red Hat for the CNCF era - where any organization can adopt open source at scale with full confidence.

### Mission

Give every organization the confidence to adopt and operate open-source cloud-native infrastructure by providing curated blueprints, AI-powered operations, and world-class expertise.

### Principles

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Open source is non-negotiable** | Blueprints are free forever. We don't create lock-in through code. |
| **Confidence, not complexity** | We sell peace of mind, not more tools to manage. |
| **Journey partnership** | We walk with customers from first cluster to production-grade platform. |
| **Convergence over components** | The value is in 41 components working together, not any single one. |
| **AI-first operations** | Every platform ships with intelligent agents that monitor, heal, and optimize. |
| **Authenticity** | No corporate buzzwords, no sugar coating. Open source ethos in everything we do. |

---

## 3. The Problem

### 3.1 The Cloud-Native Capability Gap

Most organizations face a fundamental gap between what they want and what they can achieve:

| What They Want | What They Actually Get |
|----------------|----------------------|
| "We want Kubernetes" | A cluster nobody knows how to operate |
| "We want open source" | 40+ CNCF projects with no integration story |
| "We want to avoid vendor lock-in" | 3-year OpenShift contracts they can't escape |
| "We want cloud-native" | Lift-and-shift VMs onto K8s |
| "We want observability" | Prometheus with 500 unread alerts |
| "We want security" | A compliance checkbox, not actual security posture |
| "We want AI capabilities" | A proof of concept that never reaches production |

### 3.2 The Three Root Causes

**1. They don't know how to start.**

The CNCF landscape has 1,000+ projects. Analysis paralysis is real. Every vendor claims to be the answer. Internal teams lack the experience to evaluate, select, and architect a coherent platform from these options.

**2. They can't operate the integrated whole.**

Even organizations that successfully pick technologies fail at making them work together. Security gaps between components. No tested disaster recovery. Upgrades that break integrations. Alert storms that nobody understands. The platform becomes a liability instead of an accelerator.

**3. The waiting cost is killing them.**

Every month spent building platform internally is a month competitors move ahead. Innovation is blocked by "the platform isn't ready yet." Engineering talent leaves for companies that already have cloud-native infrastructure. The opportunity cost of not experimenting compounds daily.

### 3.3 The Fear Factor

Many enterprises never attempt open source because they are afraid of operating without an insurance policy. They are accustomed to vendor relationships - someone to call, someone accountable, someone with an SLA. Open source feels like DIY. It feels lonely. The technology may be superior, but the support model feels risky.

This fear keeps organizations locked into proprietary platforms that cost more, deliver less, and create the very lock-in they wanted to avoid.

## 4. Our Solution

### 4.1 What OpenOva Is

OpenOva is both a **consultancy** and a **productized platform**. The customer chooses what they need:

```
Need a guide?     → We consult. Assessment, architecture, roadmap, enablement.
Need a platform?  → We deploy. 41 components, production-grade, in hours.
Need both?        → We do both. And we stay for Day-2 operations.
Need specialists? → Our expert network. 40+ OSS disciplines, one contract.
Need freedom?     → We migrate. From OpenShift, Oracle, Redis, Datadog - to open source.
```

### 4.2 What OpenOva Is NOT

- **Not a Kubernetes distribution.** We don't fork or rebrand Kubernetes. We curate, integrate, and support the upstream projects.
- **Not a PaaS.** We don't abstract away Kubernetes. We make it operational.
- **Not a consulting-only firm.** We have intellectual property: blueprints, meta-blueprints, Specter agents, and the Synapse gateway.
- **Not a tool vendor.** We don't sell a single product. We sell an integrated ecosystem with operational confidence.

### 4.3 The Turnkey Value

What takes organizations 2-3 years and millions of dollars to build internally, OpenOva delivers in hours. This is possible because we have already spent years building, testing, and hardening the converged ecosystem. The work is done. It is packaged as blueprints. The customer gets the result without the journey.

| Capability | Traditional Build Time | OpenOva |
|------------|----------------------|---------|
| Production K8s with GitOps | 3-6 months | Hours |
| Full observability (logs, metrics, traces) | 2-4 months | Hours |
| Multi-region DR with failover | 6-12 months | Hours |
| Zero-trust security posture | 4-8 months | Hours |
| Internal developer platform | 6-12 months | Hours |
| AI-powered operations (SOC/NOC) | 12-24 months (if ever) | Hours |
| Open Banking sandbox | 12-18 months | Hours |
| Enterprise AI platform | 12-24 months | Hours |
| **Total** | **2-3 years** | **Same day** |

---

## 5. Product Family

OpenOva maintains a minimal, authentic product naming approach. Only genuinely distinct products receive a name. Everything else uses plain language.

### 5.1 Named Products

| Product | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **OpenOva** | The core platform. 41 curated CNCF components deployed as a turnkey, production-grade Kubernetes ecosystem. Includes security, observability, GitOps, service mesh, policy engine, DR, and more. |
| **OpenOva Cortex** | Enterprise AI Hub. LLM serving (vLLM), RAG pipelines (LangServe + Milvus), graph knowledge (Neo4j), chat interfaces (LibreChat), workflow automation (n8n), and web search (SearXNG). Self-hosted AI infrastructure. |
| **OpenOva Synapse** | SaaS LLM Gateway. The neural link to Cortex. Provides managed AI inference for customers who don't want to invest in GPU infrastructure. Powers Specter agents by default. Routes to Claude, GPT-4, or self-hosted vLLM. |
| **OpenOva Fingate** | Open Banking meta-blueprint. PSD2/FAPI-compliant fintech sandbox with Keycloak (FAPI authorization), metering (OpenMeter), billing (Lago), and 6 custom banking services. Production-ready open banking in hours. |
| **OpenOva Specter** | AI-powered SOC/NOC agents. Self-healing ecosystem that monitors, detects, correlates, and remediates issues autonomously. DevOps, DevSecOps, SRE, FinOps, and Compliance agents working 24/7. Core built-in capability - not an add-on. |

### 5.2 Architecture Relationship

## 7. Target Market

### 7.1 Market Segmentation

| Segment | Size | Primary Pain | Willingness to Pay | Entry Products |
|---------|------|-------------|--------------------|----|
| **Banking & Financial Services** | Medium | Compliance + OSS fear + Open Banking mandate | Very High | OpenOva + Fingate + Specter |
| **Telecommunications** | Medium | Legacy transformation + scale + regulation | High | OpenOva + Specter + Managed Ops |
| **Government & Public Sector** | Medium | Sovereignty + compliance + budget constraints | High | OpenOva + Specter (air-gap) |
| **Insurance** | Medium | Legacy modernization + regulatory | High | OpenOva + Specter |
| **Energy & Utilities** | Small-Medium | OT/IT convergence + reliability | High | OpenOva + Specter |
| **Mid-Market Enterprise (100-1000)** | Large | "We tried K8s and failed" | Medium | OpenOva + Support |
| **Scale-ups** | Large | Outgrowing Heroku/Render | Medium | OpenOva + Cortex |
| **ISVs** | Medium | Need platform for their SaaS | Medium-High | OpenOva + Custom Blueprints |

### 7.2 Banking-First Strategy

Banks are the primary initial target for three reasons:

1. **High willingness to pay.** Financial institutions have budgets for infrastructure and compliance. They are accustomed to vendor relationships with SLAs.

2. **Regulatory pressure creates urgency.** PSD2, DORA, NIS2, and open banking mandates force banks to modernize. The cost of NOT acting is regulatory risk.

3. **OpenOva Fingate is a unique differentiator.** No other open-source support provider offers a turnkey, PSD2/FAPI-compliant open banking platform.

**Initial pipeline:** 2 potential bank clients identified for different deal structures.

**Approach for first 2-3 clients:**

| Flexible On | Not Flexible On |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Pricing (discounted for early adopters) | Architecture quality and security posture |
| Scope (custom components or integrations) | Blueprint integrity and upgrade safety |
| Payment terms (extended or milestone-based) | Open source commitment (no proprietary forks) |
| SLA tiers (negotiate response times) | Per-core pricing model (establish the unit) |
| Engagement model (mix SOW + subscription) | Never free (discounted is fine, free devalues everything) |

### 7.3 Expansion Path

```
Phase 1: Banking (0-6 months)
  └── 2-3 banks, build case studies and playbook

Phase 2: Regulated Verticals (6-18 months)
  └── Telco, government, insurance - leverage banking references

Phase 3: Broader Enterprise (18-36 months)
  └── Mid-market, scale-ups, ISVs - self-service via Synapse SaaS

Phase 4: Global Scale (36+ months)
  └── Partner network, regional presence, marketplace
```

## 8. Persona-Based Value Propositions

Every organization has multiple decision-makers. Each cares about different things. OpenOva's messaging adapts to the audience.

### 8.1 CEO / CFO / Board

**They control the budget. They are not technical. They care about risk, cost, and competitive advantage.**

> Your competitors are already cloud-native. Every month you wait costs you market position, talent, and agility.
>
> OpenOva gives you a production-grade technology platform in hours - not the 2-3 years it would take to build internally. Our AI-powered operations eliminate 70%+ of your SOC/NOC staffing needs from day one.
>
> You get the economics of open source - no per-core licensing games, no vendor lock-in - with the confidence of an enterprise support relationship.
>
> This is not a technology purchase. This is an insurance policy for your digital transformation.

**Key metrics for this persona:**
- Time to production: hours vs. years
- Cost savings: 60-85% vs. proprietary alternatives
- Headcount efficiency: 70%+ SOC/NOC reduction via Specter
- Risk reduction: SLA-backed support, certified upgrades, DR tested

### 8.2 CTO / VP Engineering

**They sponsor the initiative. They understand technology at a strategic level. They care about architecture quality, team productivity, and future-proofing.**

> You know the stack you want - Kubernetes, GitOps, observability, service mesh. But integrating 40+ CNCF projects into a secure, resilient, production-grade ecosystem takes 2-3 years and a team you cannot hire fast enough.
>
> OpenOva delivers the converged ecosystem you would build yourself - if you had the time and the team. Every component is selected, tested, and certified to work together. Multi-region DR with split-brain protection. Zero-trust security from day one. Full observability.
>
> And our AI agents (Specter) handle Day-2 operations so your engineers build features instead of babysitting infrastructure.
>
> We can be your consultant, your platform provider, or both. You choose.

**Key metrics for this persona:**
- 41 integrated CNCF components
- Multi-region DR with tested failover
- Platform team headcount reduction
- Time engineers spend on features vs. infrastructure

### 8.3 Platform Lead / DevOps Lead

**They evaluate the technology. They will operate what we deploy. They care about technical depth, no lock-in, operational reality, and open-source purity.**

> 41 curated, Kustomize-based blueprints. Cilium service mesh with eBPF mTLS. Flux GitOps. Grafana observability stack (Alloy, Loki, Mimir, Tempo). Kyverno policy-as-code with auto-generated PDBs and NetworkPolicies. CNPG for PostgreSQL. Redpanda for streaming. Valkey for caching.
>
> Multi-region with k8gb authoritative DNS, Cloudflare-witness split-brain protection, and a Failover Controller that orchestrates external traffic, internal services, and stateful workloads.
>
> Full source access. No black boxes. No proprietary agents. Every blueprint is open source and Kustomize-based. You can read every line, fork if you want, customize what you need.
>
> Plus: Specter AI agents that detect drift, correlate incidents, and remediate issues automatically. Not just alerting - actual self-healing.

**Key metrics for this persona:**
- 41 components, all upstream open source
- Kustomize-based (no proprietary abstraction)
- Air-gap capable
- Full source access, no vendor lock-in at the code level

### 8.4 CISO / Head of Security

**They are the gatekeeper. They must approve before anything moves forward. They care about compliance, security posture, auditability, and zero-trust.**

> Zero-trust from Day 1. Not aspirational - actual.
>
> eBPF-enforced network policies via Cilium. Mutual TLS everywhere via service mesh. Kyverno auto-generates PDBs, NetworkPolicies, and security contexts. Trivy scans images in CI/CD, in Harbor registry, and at runtime. Vault per-cluster with ESO PushSecrets for cross-cluster secret sync. Coraza WAF with OWASP Core Rule Set.
>
> Air-gap capable for sovereign deployments. Compliance-ready for PSD2, DORA, NIS2, SOX.
>
> Our Specter Compliance Agent provides continuous posture assessment - not periodic audits. It generates evidence, maps controls to regulations, and flags deviations in real-time. Our DevSecOps Agent patches vulnerabilities automatically based on your risk tolerance policy.

**Key metrics for this persona:**
- Zero-trust architecture from day one
- Continuous compliance posture (not periodic audits)
- Automated vulnerability remediation
- Audit evidence auto-generated

### 8.5 CFO / Procurement

**They negotiate the deal. They care about total cost of ownership, budget predictability, contract flexibility, and exit strategy.**

> Open source blueprints are free. Forever. You are paying for support, operations, and expertise - not for access to code.
>
> No per-core licensing like Red Hat. No per-node charges like Rancher. No per-host billing like Datadog. Our pricing is based on the vCPU cores under management - transparent, predictable, and fair.
>
> Enterprise Agreement with annual true-up: commit to a baseline, grow as much as you need during the year, settle the difference at renewal. Or pay-as-you-go for maximum flexibility.
>
> Exit strategy: the blueprints are open source. If you leave OpenOva, you keep everything. You just lose the support, the AI operations, and the expert network. There is no lock-in by design.

**Key metrics for this persona:**
- 60-85% cost savings vs. proprietary alternatives
- No per-core/per-node licensing games
- Clean exit strategy (keep all code if you leave)
- Budget predictability via ELA model

### 9.3 Competitive Advantages by Competitor

**vs. Red Hat OpenShift:**
OpenShift is a walled garden. Per-core licensing that escalates with scale. A curated but narrow stack (~15 components). Istio sidecars instead of eBPF. No AI-powered operations. And when you leave, you rebuild everything. OpenOva offers broader ecosystem support (41 vs ~15 components), no code lock-in, per-core pricing without the premium markup, and Specter for autonomous operations.

**vs. Rancher / SUSE:**
Rancher is a cluster management tool, not an integrated platform. It helps you manage Kubernetes, but you still build the platform yourself. No integrated GitOps, no observability stack, no policy engine, no DR automation. OpenOva is the complete platform, not just the management layer.

**vs. Upbound / Crossplane ecosystem:**
Upbound focuses on one tool (Crossplane). OpenOva uses Crossplane as one of 41 components. We don't compete with Crossplane - we include it and support it alongside 40 other projects.

**vs. Humanitec:**
Humanitec is a platform orchestrator focused on developer experience and the Score specification. It does not provide infrastructure components, security, observability, or operational support. It is complementary in concept but narrow in scope.

**vs. Big 4 Consulting (Deloitte, Accenture, etc.):**
Consulting firms sell hours. They build custom solutions that only they understand. When the engagement ends, the client is left with a bespoke platform and no ongoing support. OpenOva delivers standardized blueprints (maintainable), stays for operations (ongoing relationship), and provides AI agents (continuous value). Our blueprints are our IP - not billable hours.

**vs. DIY / In-House:**
DIY gets you full freedom but takes 2-3 years, requires a 5-10 person platform team ($600K-1.2M/year), and produces an untested, undocumented, single-point-of-failure platform. OpenOva delivers the same outcome in hours, tested, documented, with ongoing support. The ROI is immediate.

## 10. Business Model & Pricing

### 10.1 Revenue Streams

```
REVENUE STREAMS
│
├── RECURRING (Predictable)
│   ├── Platform Support Subscription (per-core)
│   ├── Managed Operations (per-core add-on)
│   ├── Specter Enhanced (per-core add-on)
│   ├── Synapse SaaS (per-core, included in base or metered)
│   └── Expert Network Retainer (hour blocks)
│
├── PROJECT-BASED (Variable)
│   ├── Platform Deployment (one-time)
│   ├── Consultancy Engagements (SOW)
│   ├── Migration Projects (SOW)
│   └── Custom Blueprint Development (SOW)
│
└── STAFF AUGMENTATION (Variable)
    ├── T&M Embedded Engineers
    └── SOW-Based Assignments
```

### 10.2 Core Principle

**Blueprints are free and open source. Always.** We never charge for access to code.

Revenue comes from:
- Support and operational guarantees (the insurance policy)
- AI-powered operations (Specter/Synapse)
- Expert access (the human network)
- Managed services (we own the pager)
- Transformation consulting (the journey)

### 10.3 Pricing Unit: vCPU Cores Under Management

The per-vCPU-core model is fair, transparent, and scales naturally with the customer's footprint. As they grow, we grow. As they scale down, the cost follows.

**Why per-core:**
- Directly correlates with infrastructure complexity and operational burden
- Industry-standard unit (familiar to procurement)
- Easy to measure and audit
- Scales linearly with actual usage

### 10.4 Contract Models

#### Enterprise License Agreement (ELA)

For organizations that want budget predictability and freedom to grow:

- **Commit** to a minimum core count for 1-3 year term
- **Grow** as much as needed during the subscription period
- **True-up** at renewal based on actual peak usage during the period
- **Benefit:** volume pricing locked in, budget certainty, growth without friction

```
Example:
  ELA signed for 100 cores at €X/core/month
  During Year 1, customer grows to 180 cores
  At renewal: true-up to 180 cores, new pricing locked
  Customer never receives surprise invoices mid-year
```

#### Pay As You Go (PAYG)

For organizations that want maximum flexibility:

- **Monthly** billing based on actual core count
- **No commitment**, no minimum term
- **Higher** per-core price (premium for flexibility)
- **Best for:** proof of concepts, seasonal workloads, evaluation period

#### SOW (Statement of Work)

For one-time engagements:

- **Fixed deliverables**, defined scope, agreed timeline and price
- **Used for:** consultancy, migration projects, custom blueprints
- Often converts to recurring subscription after project completion

#### T&M (Time & Materials)

For ongoing embedded engineering:

- **Daily or hourly rate** for dedicated OpenOva engineers
- **Embedded** in customer team, working on customer priorities
- **Long-term** engagements (months to years)

### 10.5 Service Add-Ons

| Add-On | Basis | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Managed Operations | Per-core | OpenOva owns the pager, 24/7 operational responsibility |
| Specter Enhanced | Per-core | Custom agent training, industry-specific compliance rules |
| Meta-Blueprint Support (Fingate) | Per-core | Open Banking specific support and upgrades |
| Meta-Blueprint Support (Cortex) | Per-core | AI Hub specific support, model management |
| Expert Network Hours | Block pricing | 40/80/160 hour blocks, unused hours roll 1 quarter |

### 10.6 Pricing Principles

| Principle | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Per-core, not per-component** | Customer shouldn't pay more for using more open-source tools. 41 components for the price of one subscription. |
| **Minimum ELA cap** | Ensures baseline revenue per customer. Below minimum, PAYG is available. |
| **True-up, not penalty** | Customer grows freely. True-up at renewal is a conversation, not a surprise bill. |
| **Expert hours roll over** | Builds trust. Customer doesn't lose unused hours (within 1 quarter). |
| **Never free, but flexible** | Early adopters get discounts. No customer gets free. Free devalues everything. |
| **Clean exit** | If customer leaves, they keep all blueprints and code. Only lose support, Specter, and expert access. |
